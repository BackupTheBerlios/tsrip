About
=====

tsrip is an easy to use cd ripping and encoding application. It features ogg
encoding and tagging from musicbrainz database. For getting audio data from
audio cds it uses cdparanoia. Ripping and encoding is done on the fly, so
there's no overhead in writing wav files and encoding them afterwards. Also,
tsrip enables you to tag your albums with a "DISC" tag out of the box, so you
don't need to use ugly album names like "foo (disc x)".
